# Ada Reference Card
Reference Card for the programming language [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)). It contains lists of Attributes, Aspects, Pragmas and also a list of packages in the Ada Standard Library.

## Source

The information is mainly taken from the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022):

- [Aspects](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-1.html)
- [Attributes](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-2.html)
- [Pragmas](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-L.html)

Each attribute name, aspect name and pragma name in the Ada Reference Card PDF is linked to the relevant page in the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022).

## Download

The reference card is available in LaTeX and PDF format:

- [LaTeX](https://github.com/bracke/AdaReferenceCard/blob/main/ada_reference_card_2022_a4_en.tex)
- [PDF](https://github.com/bracke/AdaReferenceCard/blob/main/ada_reference_card_2022_a4_en.pdf)

## Contributing

This is the first version and it is likely neither entirely correct nor complete.
I would therefore invite everybody to submit pull requests with changes/improvements.

In particular:

- Missing items.
- Wrong/incomplete descriptions.
- Spelling.
- Improvements to the LaTeX code.
- Translating.
