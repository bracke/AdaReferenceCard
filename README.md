# Ada Reference Card

Reference Card for the programming language [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)). It contains lists of Attributes, Aspects, Pragmas and also a list of packages in the Ada Standard Library.

*It contains the changes from newer versions of Ada up to and including Ada 2022.*

## Sources

The information is mainly taken from the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022):

- [Aspects](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-1.html)
- [Attributes](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-2.html)
- [Pragmas](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-L.html)

Each attribute name, aspect name, pragma name and package name in the Ada Reference Card PDF is linked to the relevant page in the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022).

## Download

The reference card is available in LaTeX and PDF format:
