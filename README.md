# Ada Reference Card

Reference Card for the programming language [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)). It contains lists of Attributes, Aspects, Pragmas and also a list of packages in the Ada Standard Library.

*It contains the changes from newer versions of Ada up to and including Ada 2022.*

## Sources

The information is mainly taken from the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022):

- [Aspects](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-1.html)
- [Attributes](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-K-2.html)
- [Pragmas](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-L.html)

Each attribute name, aspect name, pragma name and package name in the Ada Reference Card PDF is linked to the relevant page in the Ada Reference Manual (Ada 2022).

## Download

The reference card is available in LaTeX and PDF format:

- [LaTeX](https://github.com/bracke/AdaReferenceCard/blob/main/ada_reference_card_2022_en.tex)
- [PDF](https://github.com/bracke/AdaReferenceCard/releases)

The PDF version is available in a range of paper sizes:

- ISO A4 landscape
- ISO A4 portrait
- US Legal landscape
- US legal portrait
- ISO A2 landscape
- ISO A2 portrait

*You likely want either the ISO A4 landscape version or the US legal landscape version.*

This is the first version and it is likely neither entirely correct nor complete.
I would therefore invite everybody to submit pull requests with changes/improvements.

In particular:

- Adding missing items.
- Improving wrong/incomplete descriptions.
- Fixing spelling mistakes.

- Translations.
